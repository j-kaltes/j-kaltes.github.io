    <h1>Juggluco</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Juggluco (juggle glucose)
      is an alternative Android app for Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 1, 2 and 3
      sensors, meant for glucose control by people with diabetes. Libre 1 and
      Libre 2 sensors can be scanned via NFC to display the current value and
      the 15 minutes values out of the memory of the sensor. For Libre 2 and 3
      sensors it displays the glucose values received every minute via
      Bluetooth. </p>
    <figure> <img src="bluetoothvalue.png" alt="Juggluco" style="object-fit:contain;

          showing current glucose value received by Bluetooth</span></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The value received via Bluetooth from Libre 2 sensors, is exactly the
      same as the one received by scanning. And these same values will also be
      used in the sensor to generate the history values of the past 8 hours you
      also receive by scanning. From its introduction in 2018 until 2023, did
      Abbott Libre app use these glucose values, received via Bluetooth, only
      for glucose alarms. Only in 2023, in Librelink 2.10.0, does Abbott's Libre
      app also display the glucose values received via Bluetooth. Until then,
      they stuck with the idea that NFC scanning was a good idea. And indeed
      they were remarkably successful in terms of sales.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-US">Apps
        like the official Librelink app from Abbott display the glucose graph in
        a very reduced form in portrait mode, which maybe allows a doctor to see
        in a glimpse how well one is doing, but is insufficient for a diabetes
        patient to see exactly how the glucose curve (its peaks and troughs)
        relates to other events like carbohydrate, insulin doses or physical
        activity.</span></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Juggluco uses the whole
      screen in landscape mode for the glucose curve. With two fingers you can
      zoom the time axis in or out without any restriction (you can disable this
      in settings). Abbott has an obligatory display of glucose values from 0 to
      21 mmol/L (0-378 mg/dL), in Juggluco you can configure this in settings
      with any range you like (or change it manually by moving up and down if
      allowed in settings). The amount of insulin or food you consume can be
      added to the graph, so you can see its relation with the glucose values. </p>

    <p>By simply moving over the screen left or right you can move the curve
      backwards and forwards in time.</p>
    <p>The app contains four menus, opened by touching different fourths of the
      screen. The right most menu is the movement menu, by which you can move
      one day or one week back in time with one extra touch after opening the
      menu with a first touch. Beside this you can jump to a specific date or
      search for a specific glucose value or amount of food or insulin or
      whatever number you entered.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Naturally you can also set
      low and high glucose value alarms. For each of which you can specify
      separate ringtones in the settings. Beside this you can add medication
      reminders, setting an alarm to go off if you didn't enter a certain amount
      in a certain time interval. For example if you didn't enter long acting
      insulin between 9 and 10 in the evening.</p>

          Juggluco 2.2.0 and higher now work with US Freestyle Libre 2 sensors.<br>
        </span></li>
      <li> <span lang="en-US">Librelink usable with Freestyle Libre 2 sensors
          needs Android&nbsp; 8.</span><span lang="en-US"> Minimally Android 4.4
          is needed for </span><span lang="en-US">Juggluco. </span><span lang="en-US">
        </span><span lang="en-US">So you can try Juggluco on an old phone with
          NFC for 12 hours on a sensor after it is unusable with Abbott's
          Librelink because the 14 days period has expired. This only applies to
          European Libre 2 sensors. US Libre 2 and all Libre 3 sensors also
          require Android 8.</span> </li>
      <li><span lang="en-US">Librelink needs an e-mail address and password and
          regular contact with a server for I don't know what reasons. The last
          time I had to press a few times on accept related to altered
          conditions of use, but did Librelink know that before it made contact
          with the server? One time on holiday in an area without mobile
          internet connection, Librelink refused to function without internet
          connection. Happily I already had Juggluco, which doesn't use a
          server. Most of the activity of Librelink consists of Firebase
          Analytics gathering information on your smartphone. Juggluco doesn't
          use Firebase Analytics. Librelink sends all your glucose measurements
          to their server (as you can see in Libreview); Juggluco doesn't.</span></li>

    </figure>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">With the mirror function
      you can send data via IP/TCP from one Juggluco to another Juggluco running
      on another Android device. This has all kind of uses: transfer your data
      to a new phone or display it on an Android tablet or Android emulator to
      have a larger display. You can also set alarms in the mirror device. With
      the scan data the mirror app also receives the Bluetooth connection data,
      making it possible for <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/mirror/index.html">devices
        without NFC to connect via Bluetooth with the sensor</a>.&nbsp; You can
      also display exactly the same data on a second phone that is connected
      over the internet to a phone running Juggluco connected to the sensor (see
      <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/phones/index.html">details</a>).
      There is also a desktop command line program that can receive data from
      and resend data to Juggluco (with the program found <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/cmdline/index.html"
        title="Juggluco cmdline">here</a>).&nbsp; </p>
    <h5 style=" margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Values</h5>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> The glucose values
      received by Bluetooth differ little from the scanned values of Abbott's
      Libre/Librelink app. The values displayed in Juggluco and Abbott's Libre
      app are determined the same way, but previous readings influence displayed
      values. Consequently if you use one of them longer, they will give
      somewhat different values. When used beside each other, differences will
      diminish with time.</p>
    <h2 id="multiple">Multiple apps with the same sensor</h2>
    <p> European Libre 2 sensors can handle multiple apps on the same phone
      connected to the same sensor quite well. The alarms will become less
      reliable, but you can view two apps at the same time. Sometimes somehow
      Bluetooth stops totally after the sensor was out of reach for some time,
      something that never happens otherwise. You have to turn Bluetooth off and
      on to get it running again.</p>
    <p></p>
    Only one app will be able to establish a connection with the sensor on its
    own, except when you run a mirror Juggluco on the same phone. When there are
    connection issues while running two apps in parallel, you should kill the app
    which can't establish a connection. Mostly it is the app that last came to know
    the sensor that can make the connection. Librelink will not use Bluetooth
    when it didn't start the sensor. Juggluco will always try to establish a
    Bluetooth connection (when "Sensor via Bluetooth" is turned on). When the
    sensor was scanned with another exemplar of Juggluco or the patched
    Librelink app, you need to scan the sensor again with Juggluco after it
    failed to connect to the sensor.
    <p></p>
    <p> Apps running on different devices can't connect in parallel with the
      same sensor. Freestyle Reader will interfere more with Juggluco than the
      Librelink app. When the sensor is connected to Juggluco running on a
      WearOS watch, Abbott's Libre app will disrupt the connection (if it was
      used to start the sensor). Juggluco will normally not try to connect with
      the sensor anymore when it transfers the sensor to the watch. To be
      certain that nothing is still running somehow, you can kill Juggluco and
      let it restart itself. US/CA/AU Libre 2 sensors can't connect to multiple
      apps on the same phone in parallel. The same is true for all Libre 3
      sensors. </p>

    </figure>
    <h2 class="western" id="scan">Scan</h2>
    <p>After scanning something like the right picture above is shown. The
      number is the 'current' glucose value, the curve displays the glucose
      pattern of the past 16 minutes and is taken out of the sensor by NFC
      scanning. Abbott's Librelink app uses these values only to determine the
      angle of the arrow that displays the direction of change. The curve,
      Juggluco displayed after scanning, is drawn directly from the raw values
      and differs a bit from the values received via Bluetooth for which
      Abbott's calibration algorithm is used. With Freestyle libre 2, NFC
      scanning has become of minor interest. You only need it to startup the
      sensor, enable Bluetooth streaming and now and then to find out what is
      wrong and to get the sensor working again. </p>

    <figure> <img src="twominuteoldvalue.jpg" alt="Scan" title="Scan" style="object-fit:contain;     width:15cm;            height:auto;">
      <figcaption><span style="font-size: 0.9em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Coloring
          of a two minute old value</span></figcaption> </figure>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To display the age of the
      displayed glucose value, the Sensor Identifier under the glucose value, is
      colored in proportion to how long ago the glucose value was received from
      the sensor. The total length of the Sensor identifier is 3 minutes, thus
      if the Sensor Identifier is totally colored it was 3 minutes ago the
      glucose value was received from the sensor. If more then three minutes
      have passed since the last glucose value was received, it isn't displayed
      anymore. Immediately after a new glucose value has arrived the sensor id
      isn't colored at all, after one minute it is colored for a third. The
      screen is only refreshed on every minute tick or when the user touches the
      screen, thus not all degrees of age are immediately shown on the screen.
      If you want a number of the time of the measurement, you can save the
      glucose values with Left middle screen-&gt;Export-&gt;Stream. Touching the
      last point of the glucose curve will also display the measurement time of
      that value.</p>
    <h2>Unmeasurable extremes</h2>
    <p> Values below 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) are displayed as <b>2.2&gt;</b> (<b>40&gt;</b>), meaning that 2.2
      mmol/L (40 mg/dL) is larger than the real value. In Librelink this is show as LO. I
      myself didn't consider that very handy, especially in the beginning: at
      the moment you have to eat glucose as quickly as possible you first have
      to find out what that LO means. </p>
    <p> Values above 27.8 mmol/L (500 mg/dL)  are display <b>27.8&lt;</b> (<b>500&lt;</b>), meaning that 27.8 mmol/L (500 mg/dL) is
      smaller than the real value. In Librelink this is displayed as HI. </p>
    <h2>FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor differences</h2>
    <p>The Libre 2 sensors in the USA are different from those in Germany or the
      Netherlands. Libre 2 sensors in Australia and Canada are also reported to
      be different from European sensors.</p>
    <p> Previously US Libre 2 sensors could be used with Juggluco, but recently
      a lot of users report that newer US FreeStyle Libre 2 sensors work only
      with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freestylelibre2.app.us">Abbotts
        US Libre 2.7.2 app</a>.</p>
    <p> Now Juggluco is updated so that Juggluco 5.1.3 can also be used with the
      new US Libre 2 sensors. This works with the phone and the WearOS version
      of Juggluco. </p>
    <p>The minimum Android version is higher than before. I only know that they
      don't work with Android 6.0 and do work with Android 8.0.</p>
    <p>US Libre 2 sensors can't be started with Juggluco. If you can't get the
      official Abbott US Libre 2 app from Google Play, you can use the <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/USLibre2">patched
        US Libre 2.7.2 app</a>.</p>
    <h2 class="western"> Sensor error differences</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"> Sensor errors (373, wait
      10 minutes) are usually generated in Juggluco at exactly the same moment
      they are generated in the Libre app. An exception is that older version of
      the librelink app sometimes don't generate sensor errors when never
      versions do. So if someone compares the patched Librelink 2.3.0 app with
      Juggluco, he will sometimes see that Juggluco generates a sensor error,
      but the patched Librelink 2.3.0 will not.</p>
    <h2>FreeStyle Libre 3</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"> With Juggluco 3.0.0, it is
      also possible to connect Freestyle Libre 3 sensors directly with Juggluco:

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p> The stream of glucose values received via Bluetooth is also displayed in
      the Android status bar and a notification. The glucose value in the
      Android status bar is made as large as possible; this means that values
      consisting of more digits or containing a point are displayed in a smaller
      font than values consisting of a single digit. Some may have preferred
      consistency over readability, but I prefer the latter.</p>
    <p> On some smartphones you have to change the notifications settings to see
      the current glucose value in the Android status bar and/or on the lock
      screen. How you can do this is device dependent. In Android settings you
      can find somewhere notifications. From a list of apps you can select
      Juggluco and under Juggluco glucoseNotification and then you have all kind
      of options, like "Set as silent" (unset), "display on status bar" (set)
      and "hide details on lock screen" (unset).</p>
    <p>On Android 13 you should give Juggluco <i>Notifications permission</i></p>
    <p>It is possible that with a certain combination of lock screen color
      settings, only the icon is visible. Switching to dark mode helps.</p>
    <p>Don't set <i>"Icon only"</i> in your lock screen settings.</p>
    <p>On some smartphones, only notifications generated after the screen was
      locked are displayed, so you will not seen immediately whether the the
      change of settings was effective. </p>

    <h2>Watch</h2>
    <p>If you have a smartwatch that can receive Android notifications, you can
      select Notify in the left middle menu of Juggluco to let Juggluco generate
      an alerting Android notification every time a new glucose value arrived by
      Bluetooth. If you configure your smartwatch app to send notifications from
      Juggluco to the watch, you will receive this notification on your watch,
      so you can look every minute at your watch for you current glucose level.
      This can by useful during physical activity. Somehow it didn't work on
      the WearOS watch Samsung Galaxy Watch4, maybe because it is an ongoing
      notification.</p>
    <p>There is also a special watch app for some Garmin watches with
      touchscreen (see <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Kerfstok/index.html">Kerfstok</a>),
      wherein you can see your current glucose value, enter numbers and display
      speed and distance during activity and record it.</p>
    <p>Juggluco (version 2.1.0 and up) has a built-in xDrip web server. This
      means that xDrip watch apps can receive glucose values directly from
      Juggluco. You can turn this on in the <i>left menu-&gt;watch</i> of
      Juggluco. Use the Help button there for more information.</p>
    <p>There is now a Juggluco version that runs on WearOS. See <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/JugglucoWearOS/index.html"  onclick="location.href=this.href+'?unit='+unitstr;return false;">>https://www.juggluco.nl/JugglucoWearOS</a>

          graph</span></figcaption> </figure>
    <p>You can see the percentage of measurements falling in certain glucose
      ranges. Both for the conventional ranges (&gt;13.9 mmol/L, 10.1-13.9
      mmol/L, 3.9-10 mmol/L, 3.0-3.8 mmol/L, &lt;3.0 mmol/L or &gt;250 mg/dL, 181-250 mg/dL,
      70-180 mg/dL, 54-69 mg/dL, &lt;54 mg/dL) as the target range
      specified in settings. In the above image it is 4.0-8.0 mmol/L (or 72-144 mg/dL).</p>
    <p>Glucose Management Indicator is an empirically determined predictor of
      HbA1c taken from Bergenstal et al (2018) <a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/41/11/2275">https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/41/11/2275</a>.</p>
    <p> The summary graph is made as follows: Of every minute of the day it is
      determined how the glucose values were distributed over a given number of
      days. For example for the first minute of the day, all measurements of
      this minute for every day in this period are taken and it is determine
      under which value 50% of the values lie to get the median. For the 100%
      range, the lowest and highest values on that minute of the day in this
      period are taken. For the 90% range the values below which 5% of the
      values lie and the values below which 95% of the values lie is taken. For
      the 50% range the value below which 25% of the values lie and the value
      below which 75% of the values lie. This for every minute of the day.
      Thereafter these borders/lines are smoothed.</p>
    <p>The specific period for which these calculations are done, can be
      determined by setting the number of days by pressing <i>Days</i> and by
      the end position of the screen at the moment <i>Stats</i> in the left
      middle menu was touched. The time point of the end position of the screen
      is the end of the period over which these calculations are done, going
      back the number of days specified in <i>Days</i>, or 14 days by default.</p>
    <p>With <i>Export</i> in the left middle menu data can be saved in tab
      separated format (.tsv), thereafter you can also analyze the data using whatever
      statistics software you like. In the following link is shown how you can
      do this using the R package Iglu. <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/iglu.html">https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/iglu.html</a>

    <h1 style="line-height: 108%; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Receive
      glucose values</h1>
    <p>Starting with Juggluco 4.1.0, other apps can receive glucose values from
      a <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/glucosebroadcast.html">glucose
        broadcast</a> </p>
    <p>In Juggluco's settings you can configure Juggluco to send its glucose
      values to other apps. Juggluco can send three types of such broadcasts.</p>
    <p>The <b>Patched Libre broadcast</b> was originally used by the patched Librelink app
      and can be used to send glucose values to <a href="https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases">xDrip</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The <b>xDrip broadcast</b> was originally used by xDrip and can be used to
      send glucose values to <a href="https://wiki.aaps.app/en/latest/Getting-Started/FAQ.html">AAPS</a>.</p>
    <p>The <b>Glucodata broadcast</b> came with Juggluco and can be sent to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.trupici.g_watch">G-Watch</a>
      and <a href="https://github.com/pachi81/GlucoDataHandler/releases">GlucoDataHandler</a></p>
    <h2 class="western">LibreView</h2>
    <p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
      In settings, you can also ask Juggluco to sent glucose values to
      Libreview. For this it creates data points for every 15 minutes, by
      averaging the stream values around that point, so you don't need to scan
      to make use of it. In Libreview you can select "<i>Download Glucose Data</i>"
      to download these data to a .csv file. This data can be imported in apps
      like Diabetes:M.</p>
    <p>In Libreview under <i>Account Settings-&gt;My Devices</i> you can delete
      all data send to Libreview from a particular device. So if you don't like
      the data or want to send everything anew with a new version of Juggluco,
      you can do that. Maybe it is a good idea, to <i>decline to share your
        glucose and product-related data for the purposes of research</i> under
      <i>Account Settings-&gt;Profile</i> </p>
    <p>To also send amounts of insulin, carbohydrate, etc. to Libreview you have
      to specify for each label what should be done with it
      (Settings-&gt;Libreview-&gt;Send amounts).</p>
    <p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
      I have to mention that you can also save glucose values in Juggluco
      itself, by going to Left middle menu-&gt; export and select Stream, in
      this case you get a value for every minute. To view some statistics of
      these data you can go to Left middle menu-&gt; Statistics (see Aggregate
      data).</p>
    <h1 id="calibration"> No manual calibration</h1>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Freestyle Libre 1 and 2
      sensors as used by Abbott Librelink app are not manually calibrated;
      Finger prick glucose measurements are not used to adjust the sensor
      readouts. </p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Some people demand that
      Juggluco should add manual calibration. I don't know the exact reason why.
      Some may not known that Freestyle Libre sensors are factory calibrated.
      But I think that the reason is that they see a discrepancy between the
      sensor readout and the finger prick glucose value and hope by adjusting
      the sensor readout it will better approach the finger prick.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In Juggluco you can't
      manually calibrate, because I am afraid it will make it worse. When I look
      at my own glucose measurements, they don't diverge always in the same
      direction. The direction will also depend on what moments you do your
      finger pricks. If you check always a low sensor readout, you will find
      that the sensor readings are too low. If you do a finger prick when you
      sense a hypo, but the sensor doesn't show one, you will find that the
      sensor gives too high values.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">For some time I have sent
      the sensor glucose values from Juggluco to xDrip and have entered all my
      finger pricks as calibration data in xDrip. As a results the readings of
      xDrip were much worse than the not manually calibrated values of Juggluco.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Why should other users do
      better?</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"> There is also the
      difficulty of sensor range. The sensor doesn't give values lower than 2.2
      mmol/L. If the sensor values are more than 1.7 mmol/L lower than blood
      glucose, it can't detect hypoglycemia anymore. If the sensor gives LO
      (lower than 2.2 mmol/L), it means in reality lower than 4.2 mmol/L when
      it's readings are 2 mmol/L too low. So it can be 4.2 mmol/L (nothing to
      worry about) are 1.4 mmol/L (at the border of getting unconscious.) If a
      sensor readings consistently diverges so much from the blood glucose, you
      shouldn't use the sensor anymore.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Getting a replacement from
      Abbott can give difficulties. Although they easily replace sensors that
      fall off, they can be very difficult when you want a replacement because of
      poor readings. Probably they think that the sensors are always so bad, so
      that replacement doesn't make a difference.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Here is a list of
      restrictions, based on a <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/AbbottComparison.eml">dutch
e-mail
        I received from Abbott</a>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">You shouldn't use the
          readings of a sensor for the first 24 hours of placement;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Only trust the sensor
          when the glucose level is stable (<i>bij voorkeur nadat je de sensor
            24 uur hebt gedragen en/ of er sprake is van een stabiele situatie
            ten aanzien van de glucosewaarden (de trendpijl op de reader en/ of
            FreeStyle LibreLink app horizontaal</i>));</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">You should not compare
          them with blood at the moment of scanning, but blood 5 to 10 minutes
          before, because the sensors are so much behind compared to blood
          glucose (<i>Wacht na de vingerprik 5-10 minuten en scan dan de
            FreeStyle Libre sensor. </i>);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">You should measure the
          blood three times at different moment of the same day (<i>Indien je de
            meting uit het ISV wilt vergelijken met jouw bloedglucose dan vragen
            wij je minimaal een drietal metingen op verschillende tijdstippen
            gedurende dezelfde dag te nemen. </i>);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">You should do another
          measurement together with the Abbott customer service (<i>Hou indien
            mogelijk de sensor op de arm. Wij kunnen dan samen nog een test
            uitvoeren. </i>)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">From the telephone
      conversation with Abbott customer service I understood that they consider
      less than 30% off as acceptable. This seemed to be calculated as the
      absolute difference divided by the sensor value. Sensor measurement 2.4
      mmol/L and a blood glucose measurement of 4.9 mmol/L was interpreted as
      more than 100% difference.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">How the different
      measurements are integrated I don't know, but it sounds like they only
      accept that the sensor is wrong if it diverges at all occasions.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">I had a sensor that was off
      4 mmol/L (72 mg/dL) (the different between the sensor and blood glucose measurement was 4 mmol/L (72 mg/dL)) and the customer service didn't accept that as a fault of the
      sensor, because I had only scanned at the moment of the blood glucose
      measurement.</p>
    <h2 id="android13">Android 13</h2>
    <p>Previously there were reports of Bluetooth connection problems with devices
      running&nbsp;Android 13&nbsp;with Libre 2 and 3 sensors. It seems that
      after a system update they don’t exist anymore. I myself updated recently
      to Android 13. Bluetooth functioned perfectly. There is only one
      difference of significance: apps I killed with “Force stop” restart more
      often than under Android 12. When a US Libre 2 sensor or Libre 3 sensor
      was started with Abbott’s Libre app, that app will restart more easily and
      disrupt the connection of Juggluco with the sensor.</p>

      with all Nightscout apps: the Android app NS Client and the IOS apps
      Nightscout and Nightscout X only work with a particular Nightscout
      implementation. The last two do nothing more than displaying the
      Nightscout web page.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">For more information, see

      (4.16.0 or above) will send every glucose value received from Libre 2 or 3
      sensors to Libreview. In Abbott's Libre app under Connected
      apps-&gt;Librelinkup you can invite an e-mail address to receive these
      data. </p>
    <h2 class="western">Translations</h2>
    <p>Juggluco is currently available in English, German, Italian, French,
      Polish, Ukrainian, Portuguese, Dutch and Belarusian. There is a need for
      translations into other languages and updates to current translations. See <a
        href="https://github.com/j-kaltes/Jugglucohelp">Help</a> for more
      information.</p>
    <h2 class="western">Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>Juggluco's data can be exported to a file or sent to other apps via
      broadcasts or a web interface. There is demand for the analysis and
      display of these data, for example to send a quick overview to a medical
      practitioner.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Another possibility
is to use tar via <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/125769/how-to-install-and-use-abd-the-android-debug-bridge-utility/">adb</a>:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">First install and
run Juggluco on the new phone, then force stop Juggluco on the new
phone.</p>

while connected to the old phone:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>adb exec-out run-as tk.glucodata tar -cf    -     ./files > all.tar</b></p>
