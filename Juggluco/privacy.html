<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If a user checks
'Send to LibreView' in settings and gives a working Libreview E-Mail
address and password, glucose data will be sent to Libreview. Also
account information given to Libreview will be received by Juggluco:
FirstName, LastName, Country, DateOfBirth, GuardianLastName,
GuardianFirstName. Use of this information by Juggluco is restricted
that what is absolutely necessary to contact with Libreview and will
only be used for contact with Libreview. What Libreview does with
this information is unknown.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To take over an
already started FreeStyle Libre 3 sensor, users have to give the same
Libreview E-Mail address they used in the Libre3 app that activated
the sensor and this is used by Juggluco to get an Libreview Accound
ID from Libreview. The only use of this Account ID is sending it to
the sensor, because when a different number is sent to the sensor it
refuses to function.</p>
