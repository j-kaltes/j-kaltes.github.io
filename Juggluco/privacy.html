<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Juggluco
saves unencrypted glucose relevant data on the device itself, but
this is usually not available to other programs. Google Play and
Android possibly collect information, but I haven't done anything to
make this happen. The rest is totally under control of the user.
Information can be saved with </span><span lang="en-US"><i>'export'</i></span>
<span lang="en-US">to a local file, but not directly on a Cloud
server. With the </span><span lang="en-US"><i>'mirror'</i></span>
<span lang="en-US">function information can be sent to another IP
address encrypted or unencrypted, but this will only be done under
control of the user and to an IP address specified by the user.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If a user checks
'Send to LibreView' in settings and gives a working Libreview E-Mail
address and password, glucose data will be send to Libreview. Also
account information given to Libreview will be received by Juggluco:
FirstName, LastName, Country, DateOfBirth, GuardianLastName,
GuardianFirstName. Use of this information by Juggluco is restricted
that what is absolutely necessary to contact with Libreview and will
only be used for contact with Libreview. What Libreview does with
this information is unknown.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To take over an
already started FreeStyle Libre 3 sensor, users have to give the same
Libreview E-Mail address they used in the Libre3 app that activated
the sensor and this is used by Juggluco to get an Libreview Accound
ID from Libreview. The only use of this Account ID is sending it to
the sensor, because when a different number is send to the sensor it
refuses to function.</p>
