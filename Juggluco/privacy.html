<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Juggluco
saves unencrypted blood glucose relevant data on the device itself,
but this is usually not available to other programs. Google Play and
Android possibly collect information, but I haven't done anything to
make this happen. The rest is totally under control of the user.
Information can be saved with </span><span lang="en-US"><i>'export'</i></span>
<span lang="en-US">to a local file, but not directly on a Cloud
server. With the </span><span lang="en-US"><i>'mirror'</i></span>
<span lang="en-US">function information can be sent to another IP
address encrypted or unencrypted, but this will only be done under
control of the user and to an IP address specified by the user.</span>
<span lang="en-US">The user can make Juggluco send glucose </span><span lang="en-US">values
</span><span lang="en-US">to a Nightscout server or to let other apps
contact Juggluco via the web server or to receive glucose broadcasts.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If a user checks
'<i>Send to LibreView</i>' in settings and gives a working Libreview
E-Mail address and password, glucose data will be sent to Libreview.
Also account information given to Libreview will be received by
Juggluco: FirstName, LastName, Country, DateOfBirth,
GuardianLastName, GuardianFirstName. Use of this information by
Juggluco is restricted what is absolutely necessary to contact with
Libreview and will only be used for contact with Libreview. What
Libreview does with this information is unknown.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To take over an
already started FreeStyle Libre 3 sensor, users have to give the same
Libreview E-Mail address they used in the Libre3 app that activated
the sensor and this is used by Juggluco to get an Libreview Accound
ID from Libreview. The only use of this Account ID is sending it to
the sensor, because when a different number is sent to the sensor it
refuses to function.</p>
