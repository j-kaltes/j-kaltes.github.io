    <p><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco">Juggluco</a> is now
      ported to Wear OS. It consists of an adaptation of the smartphone version
      to the smaller screen of the watch and a watch face that shows the time,
      the current glucose value received every minute and four complication
      slots.</p>

    <p>Every sensor has to be initialized by the smartphone version of Juggluco,
      that sends the sensor data to the watch version. Thereafter, there are two
      possibilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Keep the sensor connected with the smartphone and that sends the data
          from the smartphone to the watch by TCP;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you have a watch with good functioning Bluetooth, you can also try
          a direct connection between watch and sensor.</p>
      </li>

    <p> Exact instructions on how to get the watch working is given in the
      Smartphone version of Juggluco under Left menu-&gt; watch-&gt; Wearos

    <h2>Watch-sensor connection</h2>
    <p> A direct watch-sensor connection has generally more connection errors
      than a direct connection between a good phone and sensor.</p>
    <h5>Interference</h5>
    <p> Under certain circumstances Watch4 has more status=133 connection errors
      than others. They happen more often during a walk through the neighborhood
      and during indoor sport. I first thought that it was because of movement:
      perhaps Watch4 was programmed to do something while you are active like
      automatically detecting the activity and that somehow also turned off the
      Bluetooth connection with the sensor, maybe to support other Bluetooth
      devices like fitness equipment. The fact that more than half of the
      Freestyle Libre 2 sensors and nearly all Freestyle Libre 3 sensors had no
      problems with these movements, speaks against this. I have read somewhere
      that Bluetooth devices operate at wave lengths where there is a lot of
      activity of other devices, and that they do a lot of work searching for a
      free space between all these interfering waves of other devices. Maybe it
      is more difficult to find such a free space when the surrounding waves
      change more. Thus all the other people and houses full off devices
      transmitting waves that I pass while walking is the problem. The Bluetooth
      chip in my smartphone is somehow much better, and the signal of some
      Freestyle Libre 2 sensors and nearly all Freestyle Libre 3 sensors
      stronger, so that the don't have these problems.</p>
    <h2>Watch-phone connection</h2>
    <p> Connecting the sensor indirectly with the watch should always be
      possible. Sometimes there are general disconnection problems between phone
      and watch: The android companion app can't connect with the Watch. This
      can often be solved by rebooting the phone. Another method is to find
      Bluetooth in the list of apps (including system apps) in Android settings
      on your phone and press Clear Data.<br>
      <br>
      After switching connection or returning after getting out of reach, the
      new connection is sometimes not immediately recognized. You can make it
      recognized by switching Wi-FI, Mobile Data or Bluetooth OFF-and-ON on the
      phone.</p>

    <h2 class="western">What to do when Juggluco on the watch stops receiving
      data from Juggluco on the phone?</h2>

          Watch connection with phone bottom</span></figcaption> </figure>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">See that <b>Direct
        sensor-watch connection</b> is turned <b>off</b> in the phone Left
      menu-&gt;Watch-&gt;Wearos Config.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">First of all turn Bluetooth
      On in both watch and phone. Then switch WIFI off and on in one of them, if
      that doesn't work, try the other or try the same a second time (Turning
      Bluetooth off and on can also be effective if tcp is redirected through
      Bluetooth.) Also switching from Mobile data to WIFI or the other way
      around can help. Sometimes it only works with WIFI turned on on the phone
      and WIFI in the watch Juggluco's mirror screen checked. This means that
      the Bluetooth connection between watch and phone doesn't work. Sometimes
      force closing and restarting the Watch Companion app (for example Galaxy
      Wearable) helps, sometimes rebooting phone or watch or Clearing data of
      the Bluetooth system app helps.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Now my new phone (Qualcomm
      SM8350 Snapdragon 888 5G , Octa-core: 1x2.84 GHz Cortex-X1 &amp; 3x2.42
      GHz Cortex-A78 &amp; 4x1.80 GHz Cortex-A55, 8GB RAM) has given up and I
      have to use my previous phone (Mediatek MT6757, Octa-core 4x2.3 GHz
      Cortex-A53 &amp; 4x1.6 GHz Cortex-A53, 3GB RAM) I have much more
      connection problems that seems to be cause by TCP over Bluetooth not
      working. WIFI OFF and ON, switching to mobile data or WIFI, re-init and
      sync all have no effect. But things like starting the Galaxy Wearable app,
      forced closing and starting that app, clearing the data of the Bluetooth
      app and rebooting phone and/or watch help to regain the TCP connection
      again for some time. Maybe the Galaxy Wearable app is stopped, although I
      gave both the Galaxy Wearable app and Galaxy watch4 Manager a power-saving
      exception. Maybe giving the Bluetooth system app a power-saving exception
      helps.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It is possible that the
      connection between Juggluco's on watch and phone doesn't work, because it
      was changed, therefore some screenshots are shown here of a functioning
      connection. The shown IP is automatically determined and exchanged via
      Bluetooth and don't need to be specified manually. The label is a watch
      identifier also shown in Watch-&gt;Wearos Config.</p>
    <p>If in someway the connection settings are changed and you don't know what
      they were before, you can remove all connections you have not created
      yourself from Mirror in watch and phone and press on<i> Init watch app</i>.
      This has practically the same effect as reinstalling the watch app. If you
      reinstall Juggluco on your watch, you should also remove existing
      connections. You remove a connection by going to Left-middle menu-&gt;
      Mirror on you phone or Left menu-&gt; mirror on the watch, touching the
      connection and pressing <i>Delete</i>. </p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It is very important that
      always enough storage space is available. If at a critical moment the
      device is out of storage space, it is possible that the some files are not
      created the right way and you have to reinstall Juggluco again with enough
      storage space.</p>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">With <i>"Direct

      After warm-up period, the watch should get a Bluetooth connection with the
      sensor. Sometimes some more scans are needed after the warm-up period.
      Sometimes this isn't enough, then restarting Juggluco on the watch, by
      force closing it and starting it again, may help. If this doesn't work,
      you can turn OFF <i>"Direct sensor-watch connection"</i><i> </i><span style="font-style: normal">and

    <h2 class="western"> Watchface difficulties</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes after an update
      of Juggluco, the appearance of the watch face has changed without any
      change in the program. For example the complications are not displayed.
      Changing to another watch face and back, let to the reappearance of the
      complications, but now lines appeared around the complications. Changing
      the color in the Watch face in the Watch companion app, led to the
      disappearance of these lines. </p>
    <h2 class="western"> Allow background activity</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Previously it was
      impossible turn on "<i>Allow background activity</i>" for Juggluco on
      Watch4, but after an update it is possible and it has also become
      necessary. If you don't turn it on Juggluco will be killed after some
      time.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"> On Watch4 you can turn on
      "<i>Allow background activity</i>", in the Galaxy Wearable, Watch
