Compiles and runs on my android tablet. 

It can run on an android device in two says: using the impoverished installation supplied with 
Android or after first installing a full Linux distribution. 

(You can also compile it within termux. Then you can copy settings.termux64 to settings and use bash ./configure 
instead of ./configure in case sh points to dash. Install clang++ instead of g++ and follow the general README).

ANDROIDS installation:
Use the already installed /system/bin/linker and ANDROIDs  libc.

Ubuntu contained some androideabi packages, but the programs I compiled with them 
didn't run on my tablet. Those generated by toolchains contained 
in androids NDK did work. 
 
Download and install NDK from https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html
or install it as part of the Androids SDK.



IN EARLIER VERSIONS OF ANDROID NDK you had to do this:
	Use ndk-bundle/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py
	to make an installation for the Android platform you compile for.
	make_standalone_toolchain.py -h shows how to use it.

	Something like:

	make_standalone_toolchain.py  --arch arm --api 17   --install-dir yourdir

	In yourdir/bin are then programs like arm-linux-androideabi-g++  

	Add yourdir/bin to your path

	I had to add CPPFLAGS=-D__ANDROID_API__=17 or CFLAGS=-D__ANDROID_API__=17  or CXXFLAGS=-D__ANDROID_API__=17 during compilation.
	If the compiler creates running programs, you can compile libncurses, libmagic (optional) and libre2 (optional).
	You can make the first two cross-compile by running CFLAGS=-D__ANDROID_API__=17    ./configure --host=arm-linux-androideabi --prefix=/data/local
	The last by editing Makefile.

	Throw headers in yourdir/sysroot/usr/include and libraries in yourdir/sysroot/usr/lib
	If you don't want to put the dynamic libraries on your tablet/phone, keep only the static (*.a) libraries in yourdir/sysroot/usr/lib
	so they are statically linked.

IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF NDK you have to do this:
	After installing NDK you have one of more versions in for example /home/yourlogin/Android/Sdk/ndk
	with names like 21.3.6528147.
	Here in is a directory like
	/home/yourlogin/Android/Sdk/ndk/21.3.6528147/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/
	In which you can find programs like aarch64-linux-android26-clang++

	26 stands for the ANDROID API for which to compile.
	add /home/yourlogin/Android/Sdk/ndk/21.3.6528147/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin to your path

	Decide for which  api number (e.g. 26) you want to use, and do:
	ln -s aarch64-linux-android26-clang++ aarch64-linux-android-g++
	ln -s aarch64-linux-android26-clang aarch64-linux-android-gcc

	And use aarch64-linux-android as the host name for cross compiling. e.g. say  ./configure --host=aarch64-linux-android 
	copy libncurses.a libre2.a ./libs

	from ncurses-<VERSION>/include
	copy  term.h curses.h ncurses_dll.h  unctrl.h  to ./include

	file-<VERSION>/src
	copy magic.h  to ./include

	cp -a <RE2_PATH>/re2 ./include

		



To stop bed from making a version using plugins change in ./config CONFIG_PLUGIN to
CONFIG_PLUGIN=n
Also configure bed with or change ./settings to add CPPFLAGS=-D__ANDROID_API__=17  

CPPFLAGS=-D__ANDROID_API__=17   ./configure --host=arm-linux-androideabi --prefix=/data/local


make dep;make
make install DESTDIR=adir

make an archive from the contend in adir and unpack it on your android device.

adb can be used to login to your android device and transfer files.
You can find it in ubuntu package adb or in  platform-tools/adb of Androids SDK.
First enable usb debugging mode: https://www.kingoapp.com/root-tutorials/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-mode-on-android.htm

adb devices 

Will now recognise you device if you have connected it by USB
adb shell 
Can make you login
with 
adb push archivename /data/local/tmp
you can upload the archive.

If you have installed tar and gunzip you can install it with
tar -zxf archivename -C /

If you use root, this changes to rwx permissions and ownership of /data /data/local and /data/local/tmp
to the values they have in the archive. The following values are maybe right:

drwxrwx--x  system system  	/data
drwxr-x--x  root root 		/data/local
drwxrwx--x  shell shell  	/data/local/tmp


I could also use bed after booting in recovery mode. I have installed Team Win Recovery (
https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-tab-10-1/development/recovery-twrp-3-0-x-t3522305).
They use /sbin/linker instead of /system/bin/linker, so I used a binary editor to
change /system/bin/linker into /sbin/linker in the bed binary (adding a 0 at the end in hex mode):

You can also use sed: 
sed 's/system\/bin\/linker/sbin\/linker\x0\x0\x0\x0\x0\x0/' < bed >newbed

I also had to set some environmental variables:
export TERM=rxvt
export TERMINFO=/extra/data/local/share/bed/terminfo
export BEDRC=/extra/data/local/share/bed/bedrc
export LINES=52
export COLUMNS=177


AFTER FULL LINUX DISTRIBUTION INSTALLATION:
Android builds upon a Linux kernel, but includes very few of the programs normally included in a Linux distribution.
You can install a full Linux distribution under androids Linux kernel. 
Linux deploy automatises the installation:

	https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.meefik.linuxdeploy

After that you can just use apt to install programming tools needed for the compilation. See README.

Then you can run bed on all kinds of terminal, which all have their specific problems with making the keys used by bed function.

Terminal Emulator for Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm):

	In preferences “Alt key sends ESC” should be set.


You can also use all kinds of xterm variants under X windows. 

Any program connected to XServer XSDL 1.11.40 or  https://sourceforge.net/projects/libsdl-android/files/apk/XServer-XSDL/ViewTouch-1.11.40.apk has the following problem:  Alt-e,Alt-i and Alt-N don't work. You can use Esc,e etc instead (type fast).

It is also possible to use an android VNC viewer to display X programs (including x terminals): bVNC Free, DesktopVNC and Jump worked on my computer.


When for some reason you tablet doesn’t start android, it is still possible to edit the tablets internal Flash memory with bed, 
if you can boot into recovery and connect over USB using the android debugger (adb).
You first need to install twrp  to add a new recovery Linux kernel and programs.
You boot into recovery and connect the tablet to a computer's USB.
On a computer terminal you type

set|grep TERM # to get the term value of your TERMINAL
adb devices   # to see if your tablet is recognized
adb shell 
export TERM=VALUEYOUFOUND # If that's no good try something else, for example rxvt


When using adb 
export LINES=
export COLUMNS=



To install bed in /data/local/tmp/nontmp and also run it from termux without root, you need to change selinux context on the nontmp directory tree: 

/system/bin/chcon -R u:object_r:app_data_file:s0:c179,c257,c512,c768 /data/local/tmp/nontmp 

u:object_r:app_data_file:s0:c179,c257,c512,c768 should be the same what you see when doing /system/bin/ls -Z on termux files

Because you have only executable permission in /data/local/tmp/nontmp, you should move the configuration files to /sdcard
cp bedrc to /sdcard/.bedrc and set the path in .bedrc to the configuration directories in /sdcard

This is all possible without root in adb shelll
